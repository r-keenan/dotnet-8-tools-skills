### How to run

In the root of the ChatApp folder, create an `appsettings.json` file and add the following to it. You will have to fill out the name of the model that you want to use from OpenAI and enter in your API Secret Key from OpenAI.

```json
{
  "Settings": {
    "ModelId": "<ai-model-name>",
    "OpenAISecretKey": "<openApi-secret-key"
  }
}
```
